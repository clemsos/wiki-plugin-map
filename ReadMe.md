# Federated Wiki - Map Plugin

The map plugin displays a map. Scrolling and zooming are actions that are saved in the journal.

### To add markers to the map

First line is the title, then markers

  Some title about Bilbao
  Somewhere in Bilbao >> 43,15 / -2,55
  Somewhere else in the world >> -12 / 12
